//
// This is a Gradle multi-project build.
// See settings.gradle for the subprojects.
//
// The two subprojects are:
// domain-util-library - The main domain util library that is packaged as a jar.
// domain-util-tests - A Grails app with tests using the domain-util-library.
//
// You ask: Why do this?  Because it's difficult to have AST transformers
// and integration tests in the same project.
//
// Gradle Multi-Project documentation is here:
// https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/multi_project_builds.html
//

allprojects {
    version = '0.19-SNAPSHOT'

    // Invoke with "gradle -q hello".
    // This is here just to confirm we have the subproject names configured
    // right.
    task hello << { task -> println "I'm $task.project.name" }
}
